 * Bridges a BBS raw-GL {@link Texture} (its {@code int} GL texture id) into the vanilla two-phase GUI
 * (1.21.6+) so {@link net.minecraft.client.gui.DrawContext#drawTexture} can sample it.
 *
 * <p>Zero-copy: the existing GL id is ADOPTED by subclassing {@link GlTexture}/{@link GlTextureView}
 * (their constructors are {@code protected}, so reachable from subclasses without reflection) and
 * pointing the {@code glId} field at the BBS texture. Because we wrap the live GL object, dynamic BBS
 * textures (re-uploaded into the same id, e.g. animated frames or framebuffer previews) are reflected
 * automatically — no per-frame copy.</p>
 *
 * <p>BBS owns the GL id lifecycle ({@link Texture#delete()}); this wrapper therefore must NEVER delete
 * it, so {@link #close()} and the adopted {@link GlTexture#close()} are no-ops.</p>
 *
 * <p>Each adopted texture is registered once in the vanilla {@link net.minecraft.client.texture.TextureManager}
 * under a unique {@link Identifier}; the mapping is cached weakly by BBS {@link Texture} identity.</p>
 *
 * TODO(1.21.11 render): registered wrappers are never removed from the vanilla TextureManager (small,
 * bounded leak across the bounded BBS texture set). Add explicit deregistration if texture churn grows.
