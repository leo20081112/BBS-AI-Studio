/**
 * Custom shader/render foundation for BBS, migrated from the 1.21.1 ShaderProgram + JSON
 * shader-program system to the 1.21.5+ GPU pipeline.
 *
 * In 1.21.1 each effect was a {@code net.minecraft.client.gl.ShaderProgram} constructed from a
 * {@code <name>.json} program definition that referenced {@code <name>.vsh}/{@code <name>.fsh}.
 * In 1.21.5+ {@code ShaderProgram}, {@code RenderSystem.setShader(...)} and
 * {@code GameRenderer.getXxxProgram()} were removed; the JSON program format is gone. Rendering
 * now goes through a {@link RenderPipeline} (declaring vertex/fragment shader, vertex format,
 * blend, depth, cull, samplers, uniforms) wrapped in a {@link RenderLayer} via
 * {@link RenderLayer#of(String, RenderSetup)} / {@link RenderSetup#builder(RenderPipeline)}.
 *
 * The GLSL assets (assets/bbs/shaders/core/*.vsh|*.fsh) are kept as-is and referenced through the
 * shader Identifier {@code bbs:core/<name>} (no file extension; the loader appends it).
 *
 * TODO(1.21.11 render): the kept GLSL is still in the old 1.21.1 header/import style
 * (#version 150, loose `uniform` declarations, #moj_import &lt;light.glsl&gt;/&lt;fog.glsl&gt;).
 * 1.21.5 moved built-in uniforms into std140 UBO blocks (Projection / Fog / Lighting / DynamicTransforms)
 * and changed the import set. Each kept .vsh/.fsh almost certainly needs its header rewritten to the
 * new layout-block style before it will link. That is an asset migration, tracked separately.
 *
 * TODO(1.21.11 render): the per-draw custom uniforms each effect used to set imperatively via
 * {@code program.getUniform("...")} (ColorModulator, Target, HighlightColor, Size, Filters, Blur,
 * TextureSize, IViewRotMat, the two Light directions, NormalMat) no longer exist as mutable
 * GlUniforms. They must be supplied as UBO entries / DynamicUniforms and uploaded per render pass.
 * The custom uniform set for each pipeline is documented below so the caller-migration phase can
 * wire them up. Verify at runtime.
