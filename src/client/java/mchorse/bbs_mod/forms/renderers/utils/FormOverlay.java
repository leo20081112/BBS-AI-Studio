/**
 * The colour overlay's render plumbing. The overlay rides the vanilla overlay-texture channel (the
 * UV1 vertex attribute and the texture it addresses): the fragment shader — vanilla's, the BBS model
 * shader's and an Iris pack's patched one alike — computes {@code mix(overlay.rgb, colour.rgb,
 * overlay.a)}, so a texture holding (colour, 1 - strength) tints the draw, and the effect SURVIVES
 * shader packs, which no uniform of ours can.
 *
 * <p>The swatch is not BOUND anywhere: 1.21.11 has no texture units to bind behind a draw's back, a
 * render pass binds exactly the textures its {@link RenderLayer} names. So a tinted draw is given a
 * TWIN of its layer — the same layer with this swatch named as its overlay texture instead of
 * vanilla's hurt-flash atlas (see {@link #withOverlay}). One swatch serves every twin, because the
 * colour lives in the texture rather than in the layer.</p>
 *
 * <p>A draw can carry several overlays at once. The swatch is 16&times;16, and a model's geometry is
 * one buffer per material with every bone in it, so each bone's collapsed colour claims a texel of
 * its own ({@link #slot}) and the vertices address it — that is how the form, the material and the
 * bone levels all land in a single draw. A draw with one colour simply fills the swatch with it.</p>
 *
 * <p>When the context already carries a hurt flash (overlay UV differs from the default), the flash
 * wins and the colour overlay stands down for that draw.</p>
