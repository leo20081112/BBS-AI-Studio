/**
 * Deferred translucency for forms.
 *
 * <p>Form renderers draw immediately, in entity iteration order, with depth writes on — so a
 * semi-transparent pixel drawn early would occlude anything drawn later behind it. Instead, draws
 * whose texture (or colour) has semi-transparency run twice: an immediate opaque pass (the shader
 * keeps only opaque texels, which write depth), and a command enqueued here. At the end of the
 * frame — after every form has drawn — {@link #flush()} replays the commands sorted far-to-near, so
 * translucent pixels blend over everything without ever hiding it. It is the sort, not the depth
 * mask, that keeps forms behind them visible: solid geometry keeps writing depth in the replay, so a
 * model's own semi-transparent texels still occlude the ones behind them. Only flat forms
 * (billboards, framebuffer screens, label parts) drop the depth write — they have no self-occlusion
 * to preserve.
 *
 * <p>Commands replay finished draw calls with the geometry captured at enqueue time — they never
 * re-run animation, IK or physics.
 *
 * <h2>What the 1.21.11 port changed</h2>
 * The mechanism is the 1.21.1 one; the three things it used to lean on are gone:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code PassMode} was a mutable {@code GlUniform}. It is a compile-time shader define now, so
 *       each pass is a separate {@link ModelVariant} of the model pipeline.</li>
 *   <li>Depth-write and cull were global GL toggles flipped per command inside the flush loop. They
 *       are immutable pipeline state now, so they moved into the variant too and a command carries
 *       nothing but its layer — the flush loop touches no GL state at all.</li>
 *   <li>Retention was a {@code VertexBuffer} uploaded per command. The geometry is kept as a CPU
 *       copy ({@link FormRenderCapture.Captured}, the same one the item path already uses) and
 *       re-emitted into the layer's buffer at flush.</li>
 * </ul>
