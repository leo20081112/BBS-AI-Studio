/**
 * BBS's own command queue + flusher for drawing vanilla-rendered things (entities, their held
 * items, name-tag text, fire) OUTSIDE the world's entity pass — in the film's form pass and in
 * UI viewports.
 *
 * <p>The 1.21.2 render-state split removed every immediate entity-drawing API: renderers only
 * <em>submit commands</em> into an {@link OrderedRenderCommandQueue}, and the queue is flushed
 * once per frame by the world's {@link RenderDispatcher}. BBS draws forms at its own moments
 * (AFTER_ENTITIES, editor FBO passes), so it owns a private queue and flushes it synchronously:
 * submit through {@link #queue()}, then {@link #flush()} right after. The dispatcher is built
 * over {@link FormUtilsClient#getProvider()} — the BBS recolor/substitution provider — so every
 * command family renders through the same {@code VertexConsumerProvider} the rest of the form
 * pipeline uses (and the substitution hooks keep working).
 *
 * <p>Layered customs (the new particle path) are deliberately NOT flushed through the vanilla
 * {@code LayeredCustomCommandRenderer}: it binds the client framebuffer directly (checked against
 * the 1.21.11 bytecode), which would punch UI-viewport draws onto the screen. Nothing BBS submits
 * uses them; the world's own particles go through the world's dispatcher as always.
 *
 * <p>Render thread only, non-reentrant by design (a flush must complete before the next submit
 * cycle; nested form-in-form draws all land in the same cycle before the single flush).
