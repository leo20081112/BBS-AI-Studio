/**
 * The round parts of the gizmo: the three rotation rings, the view ring that always faces
 * the camera, and the sphere they sit around. Split out of {@link Gizmo} because their
 * geometry answers to something else entirely — the axes scale and thickness settings —
 * and is therefore cached rather than rebuilt, while everything else in the gizmo is drawn
 * from the current frame's state.
 *
 * <p>One instance per gizmo; it owns the cached geometry and rebuilds it when the settings move.
 *
 * <p>The cache is a CPU one. 1.21.1 held each shape in a {@code VertexBuffer} and re-drew it with a
 * different {@code RenderSystem.setShaderColor} per pass; the 1.21.5+ GPU rewrite removed both, so
 * colour has to reach the vertices themselves and the geometry is re-emitted every draw. What the
 * cache still saves is the part that actually cost — the tessellation of a 96&times;24 torus, nine
 * times a frame — while re-emitting is a transform and a copy of vertices already computed. Same
 * bargain {@link mchorse.bbs_mod.cubic.render.vao.ModelVAO} struck for cubic models.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here submits: the write methods fill a {@link BufferBuilder} the caller opened, so a
 * whole gizmo pass — rings, view ring and handle boxes alike — leaves as one draw.
