/**
 * Blurs what is on screen under an overlay panel, on top of the dimming — the way the game's
 * own menus do it from 1.21 on. Two passes of a box blur over the main framebuffer, with the
 * overlay landing sharp on top.
 *
 * <p>The GUI in 1.21.11 is deferred: {@code Batcher2D} only records into the
 * {@link net.minecraft.client.gui.render.state.GuiRenderState}, and nothing reaches the
 * framebuffer until {@code GuiRenderer.render()} composites it after {@code Screen.render}
 * returns. Blurring the framebuffer at the moment an overlay paints would therefore blur the
 * bare world and leave every panel drawn so far sharp on top of it. So this class works the
 * way vanilla's own {@code DrawContext.applyBlur()} does — as a marker: {@link #apply} opens a
 * fresh root layer and records the blur there, and {@code GuiRenderer.renderPreparedDraws}
 * composites the layers before the marker, runs the blur (its call to
 * {@code GameRenderer.renderBlur} is redirected into {@link #render}), then draws the rest.
 * Everything recorded before the call ends up under the glass, the caller's own dim and
 * chrome on top.</p>
 *
 * <p>The effect is built in code rather than read from a json, so the radius is a live value
 * from the settings. 1.21.1 could load a bare json and add the passes by hand afterwards; in
 * 1.21.11 a {@link PostEffectProcessor} is parsed whole from a {@link PostEffectPipeline} and
 * carries its uniform VALUES with it, so a json would have to name one fixed radius. Assembling
 * the pipeline here keeps the setting, at the cost of rebuilding when it changes — which is
 * exactly as often as the user drags the slider.</p>
 *
 * <p>Once per frame, and this time without exception: the render state holds a single blur
 * layer, and {@code GuiRenderState.applyBlur} throws on a second one. A panel that blurred the
 * world under itself and an overlay that comes up over that panel share one pass.</p>
