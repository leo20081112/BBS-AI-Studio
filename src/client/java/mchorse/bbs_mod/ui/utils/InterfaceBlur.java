/**
 * Blurs what is on screen under an overlay panel, on top of the dimming — the way the game's
 * own menus do it from 1.21 on. Two passes of vanilla's own blur program over the main
 * framebuffer, run at the moment the first overlay of the frame is about to paint its dim:
 * everything drawn so far, world and interface alike, is what gets blurred, and the overlay
 * lands sharp on top.
 *
 * <p>The passes are added by hand rather than read from a json, so the radius is a uniform
 * set every frame from the settings, not a number baked into a file.</p>
 *
 * <p>Once per frame, with one exception: a second overlay over the first would only blur the
 * blur, but the world under a panel and the panel under an overlay are two different pictures,
 * and each gets its own pass — see {@link #applyUnder()}.</p>
